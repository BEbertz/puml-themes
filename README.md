# puml-themes
Themes for [plantuml](https://plantuml.com/), which is a diagraming tool that reads in markup to create diagrams. The out of box style might not suit everyone's needs, so Puml Themes is a set of themes for different styles. Many of these themes are based off of the [bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) project, which has themes for [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
