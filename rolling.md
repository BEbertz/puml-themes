## Rolling Your Own Theme

1. Clone or fork this repo
2. Create a new directory under the themes/ direction with the name of your theme
3. Copy an existing *.puml file (i.e. puml-theme-cerulean.puml) into the new directory, and name it ``puml-theme-<theme name>.puml``
4. Open the new file for editing
5. Change the ``$THEME`` variable to the name of your theme.
6. Change the ``$BGCOLOR`` variable to the default background color of the theme
7. Proceed to edit the file to make changes to the colors. Most likely you will only need to make changes to the variables that are declared towards the top of the file.
8. Submit pull request for the new theme, or you can host it on your own if you want.

Cheers!
